## Reactivation DM Scripts

### Tier 1: Recently Lapsed (2-4 Weeks Inactive)
```
Hey [name], it's been a bit! Hope things are going well.

Wanted to share a few things you might have missed:

- [Highlight 1: specific discussion or resource with link]
- [Highlight 2: upcoming event they'd care about]
- [Highlight 3: member win or community update]

No pressure to be active all the time — just didn't want you to
miss the good stuff.
```

### Tier 2: Long-Term Inactive (1-3 Months)
```
Hey [name], checking in.

[Community] has grown a lot since you were last active. A few things
that might bring you back:

🔥 [Big change or improvement since they left]
📅 [Upcoming event worth attending]
💡 [Resource or discussion on a topic they previously engaged with]

We'd love to have you back in the conversation. But if the community
isn't serving you anymore, that's okay too — I'd genuinely appreciate
knowing why (helps us improve).
```

### Tier 3: Former Power User
```
Hey [name], I miss seeing you around [community]!

You were one of our most [active/helpful/insightful] members, and
your absence is felt.

I wanted to ask directly: is there something we could do to bring
you back? Whether it's:
- Something that changed that didn't work for you
- A format or program you'd like to see
- Life just got busy (totally valid)

Your perspective meant a lot to the community, and it would mean a
lot to me to understand what happened.

Either way, thanks for everything you contributed.
```

[Event/program name] on [date]
[1-2 sentences about why it's relevant to them based on their past activity]
