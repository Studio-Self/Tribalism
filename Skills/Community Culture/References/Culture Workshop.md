# Culture Workshop Guide

Facilitation guide for defining community values, norms, and identity with your founding members.

---

## Values Definition Workshop

### Overview
- **Duration:** 60-90 minutes
- **Participants:** 8-15 founding or core members + community team
- **Format:** Video call with collaborative doc (Notion, Google Doc, or Miro)
- **Outcome:** 3-5 defined community values with examples

### Pre-Work (Send 48 Hours Before)
```
Before our culture workshop, please think about:

1. Why did you join [community name]? What drew you in?
2. Describe a moment in the community that felt really good. What happened?
3. Describe a moment that felt off or wrong. What happened?
4. Complete this sentence: "The best communities I've been in are ones where..."

You don't need to write these down — just think about them.
See you [date]!
```

### Facilitation Script

**Opening (5 min)**
```
Thanks for being here. Today we're defining what [community name]
stands for — the values that guide how we interact, what we celebrate,
and what we don't tolerate.

These aren't corporate values on a wall. They're the real behaviors
that make this community special.

Ground rules for today:
- Every perspective matters
- We're looking for honesty, not consensus
- There are no wrong answers
- I'll facilitate, but this is YOUR community to define
```

**Exercise 1: Peak Moments (15 min)**
```
Think about your best moment in this community (or in any community).

Share it in the doc/chat:
- What happened?
- How did it feel?
- What made it special?

[Give 5 min to write, then 10 min to discuss patterns]

"What patterns do we see? What values show up across these stories?"
```

**Exercise 2: Anti-Values (10 min)**
```
Now think about the opposite. What behaviors would kill this community?

Share:
- What's the worst thing a member could do?
- What behavior would make you leave?

[5 min to write, 5 min to discuss]

"These anti-values help us define what we stand FOR."
```

**Exercise 3: Value Drafting (20 min)**
```
Based on what we've heard, let's draft 3-5 values.

For each value, define:
- The value name (2-4 words)
- What it means (1-2 sentences)
- What it looks like in practice (1-2 examples)
- What violating it looks like (1-2 examples)

[Collaborative drafting in real-time doc. Facilitator captures
themes from Exercises 1-2 and proposes draft values.
Group refines together.]
```

**Exercise 3 Output Template:**
```
### Value: [Name]
**What it means:** [Definition]
**In practice:**
- [Positive example 1]
- [Positive example 2]
**Violation:**
- [Negative example 1]
- [Negative example 2]
```

**Exercise 4: Identity Statement (10 min)**
```
Let's write our identity statement.

Complete this together:

"We are _________ who believe in _________. We exist to _________.
We are NOT _________ and we don't _________."

[Collaborative drafting. Go around and get input from everyone.]
```

**Closing (5 min)**
```
Here's what we've defined today:

[Read back the values and identity statement]

Next steps:
1. I'll clean this up and share it with the group for final feedback
2. We'll publish it in [community guidelines/about page]
3. These values will guide everything — how we moderate, what we
   celebrate, who we invite

Thank you. You just defined the soul of this community.
```

## Culture Audit Template

Use this quarterly or when culture feels off.

```
## Culture Audit — [Date]

### Values Alignment Check

For each defined value, rate 1-5:

| Value | How Well We Live It | Evidence | Gap |
|-------|-------------------|----------|-----|
| [Value 1] | [1-5] | [Examples] | [What's missing] |
| [Value 2] | [1-5] | [Examples] | [What's missing] |
| [Value 3] | [1-5] | [Examples] | [What's missing] |

### Behavioral Signals

| Healthy Signal | Present? | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| New members adapt to norms quickly | Y/N | |
| Members self-correct without mod intervention | Y/N | |
| Members use similar language to describe the community | Y/N | |
| Diverse voices participate (not just the same 5 people) | Y/N | |
| Conflicts are handled constructively | Y/N | |
| Members feel comfortable being vulnerable | Y/N | |
| Old members are still engaged | Y/N | |

### Warning Signals

| Risk Signal | Present? | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Cliques excluding newcomers | Y/N | |
| Tone shifting negative | Y/N | |
| Moderators constantly putting out fires | Y/N | |
| Long-time members disengaging | Y/N | |
| New members confused about norms | Y/N | |
| One person or clique dominating | Y/N | |

### Recommendations
1. [Action to strengthen culture]
2. [Action to address warning signal]
3. [Action to reinforce values]

## Named Culture Examples

**Stripe's developer community:** Culture of technical rigor and "move fast, carefully." Open about trade-offs. Never condescending to beginners. Set by engineering leadership modeling those behaviors.

**Indie Hackers:** Culture of transparency. Members share revenue numbers, failed experiments, and honest struggles. Set by the founder (Courtland Allen) sharing his own building-in-public journey. The norm of transparency is so strong that members who brag without substance get gently redirected.

**Dev.to (Forem):** Culture of radical inclusion. "Newbies welcome" is a core identity. Senior developers answer basic questions without gatekeeping. Reinforced through community guidelines that explicitly value beginners and the tag system that lets people find their level.

**Y Combinator / Hacker News:** Culture of intellectual honesty. Disagree with evidence, not emotion. Ad hominem attacks are actively moderated. The culture was set by pg's (Paul Graham's) essay writing style — analytical, curious, willing to be wrong.
