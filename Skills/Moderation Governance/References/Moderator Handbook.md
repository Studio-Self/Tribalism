## Decision Tree: How to Handle Issues

### Step 1: Assess
```
Is this a guideline violation?
├── YES → Go to Step 2
├── MAYBE → Check the grey area guide below
└── NO → No action needed
```

### Step 2: Determine Severity

| Severity | Examples | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Low** | Off-topic post, mild tone issue, minor self-promo | Redirect or gentle reminder |
| **Medium** | Repeated off-topic, disrespectful tone, unwanted DMs | Warning DM + document |
| **High** | Harassment, hate speech, doxxing, explicit content | Remove content + temp mute + escalate |
| **Critical** | Threats, illegal content, child safety | Remove + ban + report to platform + escalate immediately |

### Step 3: Take Action

**For Low severity:**
```
Hey [name], just a heads-up — this is a better fit for #[correct channel].
I'll move it over. Thanks!
```
Or:
```
Hey [name], love the enthusiasm! We keep self-promotion in #promotions
though. Would you mind reposting there?
```

**For Medium severity:**
Send a private warning DM:
```
Hey [name],

I want to flag your recent message in #[channel]:

"[Quote the specific content]"

This falls under our guideline on [specific rule]. I know you probably
didn't mean it this way, but [explain impact — e.g., "it came across
as dismissive of [member]'s question"].

Could you [specific ask: edit the message, adjust your tone, take the
conversation to DMs]?

If you have questions about our guidelines, happy to chat.

— [Your name], Moderator
```

**For High severity:**
1. Remove the content immediately
2. Mute the member (24-72 hours depending on severity)
3. Send warning DM (see template above)
4. Document in #mod-log
5. Escalate to community team

**For Critical severity:**
1. Remove content immediately
2. Ban the member immediately
3. Report to platform (if applicable)
4. Escalate to community team ASAP
5. If threats: screenshot everything before removing

## Grey Area Guide

Not everything is black and white. Here's how to handle common grey areas:

### "Is this self-promotion?"
- **Okay:** Member shares their work in context of a relevant discussion, adds value beyond just a link
- **Grey:** Member shares their work without much context but it's genuinely relevant
- **Not okay:** Member posts links to their stuff with no context, repeatedly, across channels
- **Rule of thumb:** Has this person contributed to the community 5+ times for every 1 self-promo?

### "Is this too heated?"
- **Okay:** Strong disagreement focused on ideas, respectful tone, using evidence
- **Grey:** Getting personal but not directly attacking, frustrated tone, sarcasm
- **Not okay:** Personal attacks, name-calling, mocking, dismissing someone's entire identity/experience
- **Rule of thumb:** Would the people in this conversation be comfortable if their boss read it?

### "Is this off-topic?"
- **Okay:** Tangentially related, conversation evolved naturally, people are engaged
- **Grey:** Pretty far off-topic but people are enjoying it
- **Not okay:** Completely unrelated, political/religious debates that don't match community purpose
- **Rule of thumb:** Would a new member finding this thread understand what this community is about?

### "Is this person just having a bad day?"
- **Check their history.** First offense from a usually-good member? Gentle redirect.
- **Pattern of behavior?** Escalate to warning.
- **Everyone gets one bad day.** But patterns require action.

### "Should I intervene or let the community self-regulate?"
- **Let it self-regulate if:** Other members are gently redirecting, it's low-severity, the community's response is appropriate
- **Intervene if:** Nobody's addressing it, it's escalating, a member seems uncomfortable, it's been going on for more than a few messages

## Handling Specific Situations

### Member Complains About Moderation Decision
```
I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you sharing it directly
with me.

Here's the reasoning behind the decision: [Explain calmly]

Our guidelines say [quote relevant guideline]. The action was consistent
with how we handle these situations.

If you disagree, you can reach out to [community manager] for a second
opinion. We want to be fair.
```

### Two Members in Conflict
1. Don't take sides publicly
2. DM each person separately to understand their perspective
3. If it's a misunderstanding, help them see each other's point of view
4. If it's a genuine conflict, suggest they take it to DMs or mediate a private conversation
5. If one party is clearly violating guidelines, handle that separately

### Member Reports Another Member
1. Thank them for reporting: "Thanks for flagging this. We'll look into it."
2. Never reveal who reported
3. Investigate the report
4. Take action based on the decision tree above
5. Follow up with the reporter: "We've looked into it and taken appropriate action."
6. Never share details of what action was taken on someone else

### High-Profile Member Breaking Rules
- Same rules apply. No exceptions for popular or high-contributing members.
- One toxic high-profile member will drive away 10+ good members.
- Handle it privately first. If they don't change, enforce consequences.
- Document everything — high-profile removals can create community drama.

## Self-Care for Moderators

Moderation is emotionally draining. Take care of yourself.

- **Set boundaries:** You're not available 24/7. Log off.
- **Rotate heavy duties:** Don't always be the one handling toxic members.
- **Debrief with peers:** Talk to other moderators about hard situations.
- **Take breaks:** Step back when you need to. The community will survive.
- **Flag burnout early:** If moderation stops feeling rewarding, tell the community team.

**Burnout warning signs:**
- Dreading opening the community
- Getting personally angry at members
- Feeling unappreciated
- Spending more time than expected without acknowledgment
- Carrying community stress into personal life

If you're experiencing these, reach out to [community manager]. We'll adjust your load.
