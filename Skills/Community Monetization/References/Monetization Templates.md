## Revenue Calculator

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Model

```
MRR = (Free members × $0) + (Pro members × $X) + (Premium members × $Y)

Example:
- 500 free members × $0 = $0
- 75 pro members × $49/mo = $3,675
- 15 premium members × $149/mo = $2,235
- Total MRR = $5,910
- Annual Run Rate = $70,920
```

### Conversion Rate Assumptions

| Stage | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Visitor → Free signup | 15% | 20% | 30% |
| Free → Pro upgrade | 3% | 5% | 8% |
| Pro → Premium upgrade | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| Monthly churn (Pro) | 8% | 5% | 3% |
| Monthly churn (Premium) | 5% | 3% | 2% |

### Sponsorship Revenue Model

```
Monthly sponsorship revenue =
  (Newsletter sponsorships × $X/issue × issues/month)
  + (Event sponsorships × $X/event × events/month)
  + (Channel sponsorships × $X/month)

Example:
- 4 newsletter issues × $500/issue = $2,000
- 2 event sponsorships × $1,000/event = $2,000
- 1 channel sponsorship × $1,500/month = $1,500
- Total monthly sponsorship = $5,500
```
