# Ambassador Program Playbook

Templates, examples, and detailed guidance for running ambassador programs.

---

## Program Examples

### Example 1: Product Community Ambassadors (Notion-style)

**Program name:** Notion Ambassadors
**Model:** Tiered, application-based
**Size:** ~300 ambassadors globally
**What ambassadors do:** Create content (templates, tutorials), host meetups, translate docs, represent Notion at events
**Perks:** Free Notion Plus plan, exclusive swag, early feature access, direct team access, event sponsorship
**Why it works:** Ambassadors are genuine power users who create organic content and host local events — extending Notion's reach without paid marketing

**Key takeaway:** Product-led ambassador programs scale when ambassadors create genuine value for themselves (content, audience, credibility) while also driving product adoption.

### Example 2: Professional Community Champions (Salesforce Trailblazer-style)

**Program name:** Trailblazer Community Champions
**Model:** Point-based, earned through contribution
**Size:** ~5,000 MVPs globally
**What champions do:** Answer questions, create learning content, host community events, provide product feedback
**Perks:** MVP status, conference passes, direct product team access, early beta access, career development
**Why it works:** The point system is transparent — anyone can see what's required. Champions earn status through helping others, which creates a massive peer-support network.

**Key takeaway:** Point-based systems work when the path is clear and the rewards are genuinely valuable (conference passes, career credential, direct access).

### Example 3: Creator Community Leaders (Morning Brew-style)

**Program name:** Ambassador referral program
**Model:** Referral-based, tiered rewards
**What ambassadors do:** Share referral links, create content featuring the newsletter, host discussions
**Perks:** Exclusive merch tiers, featured in newsletter, access to founder, revenue share at top tiers
**Why it works:** Clear, gamified reward tiers visible to all participants — members compete and collaborate to hit the next tier.

**Key takeaway:** Referral-based ambassador programs work when rewards are tangible, tiered, and progressively more exciting.
