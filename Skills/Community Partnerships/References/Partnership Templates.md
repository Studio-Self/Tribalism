## Partnership Outreach Templates

### Cold Outreach (Email/DM)
```
Subject: Community collab idea — [Your Community] × [Their Community]

Hey [name],

I run [your community] — a community of [X] [audience description].
I've been following [their community] and there's a natural overlap
in our audiences.

I have a specific collab idea:

[Choose one:]
→ Co-host an AMA/workshop on [topic] — combining our audiences
→ Cross-promote via our newsletters ([X] subscribers each)
→ Guest content swap — your expertise in our community, ours in yours
→ Co-create a [resource/guide/report] on [topic]

For context:
- Our community has [X] active members
- Weekly engagement: [X posts/messages per week]
- Newsletter: [X] subscribers, [X]% open rate

I think this would be a win-win because [specific reason — what they
get out of it].

Open to a quick 15-min call to explore?

### Warm Outreach (Existing Relationship)
```
Hey [name],

I've been thinking about a collab between [your community] and [theirs].

Our audiences overlap on [topic] and I think there's a natural partnership:

[Specific idea — be concrete]

What I can bring:
- [What you'll contribute]

What I'd love from your side:
- [What you'd hope they contribute]

Low-commitment test: we could start with one [event/content piece/swap]
and see how it goes before committing to anything ongoing.

Thoughts?
