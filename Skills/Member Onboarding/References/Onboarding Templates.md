Hey [name],

Every great community has a culture. Here's ours:

**We do:**
- Share generously (no gatekeeping)
- Give specific, honest feedback
- Celebrate effort, not just results
- Help newcomers feel welcome

**We don't:**
- Self-promote without adding value
- Lurk forever without contributing (you'll get more by giving)
- Share others' content outside the community without permission

**The vibe:** Think [2-3 word description: "smart friends at a dinner party"
/ "trusted colleagues at a great company" / "your favorite conference,
every week"]

— [Name]
```

**Email 4: Value Proof (Day 7)**
```

- [Event name] covered [topic] → [recording link]
- [X] members helped [member] solve [specific problem] → [link]

All of this happened because [X] people like you showed up.

The more you put in, the more you get back. That's how this works.

— [Name]
```

*Same as free sequence Email 4.*

**Email 6: Deeper Engagement (Day 14)**
```
Subject: Ready to go deeper?

Hey [name],

You've been here 2 weeks. If you're ready to go deeper, here are
3 ways to get more value:

1. **Join a study group** — [description + link]
   Small group, high accountability, real progress.

2. **Submit to the spotlight** — [description + link]
   Get featured and get feedback from the community.

3. **Host a discussion** — [description + how to]
   Share your expertise. The community will love you for it.

None of these are mandatory. But the members who get the most
value are the ones who contribute.

— [Name]
```

**Email 7: Renewal Prep (Day 21)**
```
Subject: Your first month — how's it going?

Hey [name],

Your first month is almost up. Two questions:

1. Has [community] been worth it?
2. What could we do better?

[Link to 2-question survey]

If it's been valuable, the best thing you can do is invite one
person who'd be a great fit: [referral link]

If it hasn't, I genuinely want to know why so we can fix it.
