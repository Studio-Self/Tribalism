# Orbit Integration Guide

## Overview
Orbit is a community analytics tool focused on member journey tracking, particularly strong for developer and open source communities.

## Use Cases
- Track member contributions and growth
- Identify community champions
- Measure community-to-product pipeline
- Understand member lifecycle stages

## Key Concepts
- **Love**: A measure of member engagement and value
- **Reach**: A member's influence and network
- **Orbit levels**: Categorize members by engagement (1 = most engaged, 4 = least)

## Setup
1. Connect platforms (GitHub, Discord, Slack, Twitter, etc.)
2. Set up custom activities and weights
3. Configure orbit levels based on your community
4. Connect to CRM for business attribution

## Best Practices
- Use orbit levels to prioritize personal outreach
- Track "gravitational pull" — are you attracting the right people?
- Set up reports for stakeholder communication
- Use the API for custom dashboards
