# Slack Integration Guide

## Overview
Slack is a messaging platform primarily used in professional and B2B contexts. Familiar to most knowledge workers, making it a low-friction choice for professional communities.

## Community Setup

### Channel Structure
```
#welcome (onboarding and orientation)
#general (main discussion)
#introductions (new member intros)
#topic-channels (2-3 focused topics)
#random (off-topic, social)
#feedback (community suggestions)
```

### Key Limitations
- Free tier: 90-day message history limit
- Pro tier: $7.25/user/month (expensive at scale)
- No native events or courses
- Limited discovery features

### Workflows
- Use Slack Workflows for onboarding sequences
- Slackbot custom responses for FAQs
- Channel topic templates for structure

### Integrations
- **Donut**: Automated 1:1 matching
- **Polly**: Polls and surveys
- **Zapier**: Connect to CRM, email, and other tools
- **Notion**: Shared knowledge base

## Best Practices
- Use threads aggressively to keep channels clean
- Pin important messages in each channel
- Set channel purposes and topics
- Use Slack Connect for partnerships
- Create a #start-here channel with navigation guide
