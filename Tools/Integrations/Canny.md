# Canny Integration Guide

## Overview
Canny is a feature request and feedback management tool that lets community members submit, vote on, and track feature requests.

## Use Cases
- Structured feature request collection
- Community-driven prioritization via voting
- Closing the feedback loop (status updates)
- Product roadmap transparency

## Setup
1. Create boards (Feature Requests, Bug Reports, etc.)
2. Embed in your community or product
3. Enable SSO for seamless member experience
4. Set up status categories (Under Review, Planned, In Progress, Complete)

## Key Features
- Member voting on feature requests
- Status updates that notify voters
- Changelog for shipped features
- Integration with project management tools (Jira, Linear, Asana)

## Best Practices
- Review and merge duplicate requests regularly
- Update statuses frequently (members need to see movement)
- Use the changelog to close the loop: "You requested, we built"
- Link Canny posts from community discussions about features
