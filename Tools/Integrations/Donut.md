# Donut Integration Guide

## Overview
Donut is a Slack integration that automatically pairs community members for 1:1 conversations, fostering relationship building at scale.

## Use Cases
- Random coffee chat matching
- Mentorship pairing
- New member buddy system
- Cross-team or cross-channel networking

## Setup
1. Install Donut in your Slack workspace
2. Create a Donut channel (#coffee-chats, #random-intros)
3. Members opt in by joining the channel
4. Configure matching frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
5. Customize intro message

## Key Features
- Automatic random pairing
- Customizable matching criteria
- Conversation starters included
- Analytics on participation rates

## Best Practices
- Set bi-weekly cadence (weekly is too frequent for most)
- Include conversation starter prompts
- Share highlights from great pairings (with permission)
- Use it as part of onboarding (pair new members with veterans)
