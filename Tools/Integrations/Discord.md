# Discord Integration Guide

## Overview
Discord is a free real-time chat platform widely used for gaming, creator, developer, and tech communities. It offers text channels, voice channels, video, screen sharing, and a rich bot ecosystem.

## Community Setup

### Server Structure
- Start with 3-5 channels, not 20
- Use categories to group channels logically
- Create role-gated channels to reward progression

### Recommended Starting Channels
```
WELCOME
├── #welcome (read-only, rules and orientation)
├── #introductions (new member intros)

COMMUNITY
├── #general (main discussion)
├── #topic-1 (primary topic)
├── #topic-2 (secondary topic)

META
├── #feedback (suggestions for the community)
├── #announcements (read-only, team updates)
```

### Roles
- Use roles for member progression (New → Member → Contributor → Leader)
- Reaction roles let members self-select interests
- Color-code roles for visual hierarchy

### Bots
- **MEE6 or Carl-bot**: Automod, welcome messages, level system
- **Donut or Hallway**: Member matching for 1:1s
- **Ticket bot**: Private support channels

## Best Practices
- Enable Server Discovery for organic growth
- Use threads to keep channels clean
- Set up automod before you need it
- Use Forum channels for persistent Q&A
- Stage channels for events and AMAs
