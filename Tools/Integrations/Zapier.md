# Zapier Integration Guide

## Overview
Zapier connects your community tools with no-code automation, enabling workflows between platforms that don't natively integrate.

## Community Automation Examples

### New Member Workflows
- New Discord/Slack member → Add to email list
- New community member → Create CRM contact
- New paid member (Stripe) → Grant community access + welcome email

### Engagement Workflows
- New community post → Share in team Slack channel
- Weekly → Post discussion prompt in community
- Event registration (Luma) → Add to community + send prep email

### Moderation Workflows
- Flag keyword detected → Notify moderator
- New member from specific source → Route to specific channel

### Analytics Workflows
- Weekly → Compile metrics and send report email
- New feedback submission → Log in spreadsheet + notify product team

## Best Practices
- Start with 2-3 critical automations, not 20
- Test thoroughly before enabling
- Monitor for errors weekly
- Document your Zaps so others can maintain them
- Use filters to avoid false triggers
